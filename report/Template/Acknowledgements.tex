I would like to use this space to firstly thank my supervisors Jose Refojo and Kirk Soodhalter; Jose for all his help, involving anything everything CUDA related and for going out of his way to come in on weekends to assist in doing my profiling. Kirk for all his help and guidance with the mathematics behind the finite element method and for always making himself available even when on different time-zones. I would like to thank both my parents, my grandmother and my sister, for all their help and support, and without whom, my completion of this degree would not have been possible. I would like to thank my lecturers and my classmates for their assistance throughout the year. Finally, I would like to give a thank you to all my family, friends, and in particular my housemates, and anyone else who supported me and listened to my complaints through what was a tough but enjoyable year . Thank you all.
